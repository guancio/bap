This is similar to the version of STP which was submitted to the SMTCOMP 2011.

It:
* Is based on r1368 from STP's subversion repository.
* Is statically compiled for a 64-bit Linux computer.
* Creates an always-interactive yacc parser, rather then the standard parser. This means it can be sent some of the SMTLIB2 control language. Without this option the parser buffers input.
* Has a special encoding of multiplication that is better for hard problems. Hard problems taking say > 50 seconds to solve. To get the "standard" behaviour, use the --config_multiplication_variant=3 command line option.
